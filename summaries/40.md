## Concise Summary:

This lesson delves into the concept of navigating difficult emotions, drawing from the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  The main point is that our emotions should be controlled by the Holy Spirit, not the other way around. The lecture provides five principles for aligning our emotions with God's Word: recognizing when our emotions are not yielded to the Spirit, confessing that sin to God, purposing to keep that sin out of our lives, replacing negative emotions with positive words, and seeking godly counsel and accountability.
