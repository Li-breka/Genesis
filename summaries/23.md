## Concise Summary:

This class session focused on the concept of "Live It Out" from the creation story, emphasizing the importance of living out one's faith based on biblical truths. The lesson involved students actively engaging in a discussion by articulating a biblical truth, providing supporting scripture passages, and applying the truth to their own lives. The instructor also highlighted the importance of a literal interpretation of Scripture, contrasting it with theistic evolution, and discussed the dangers of adopting a worldview that prioritizes cultural beliefs over biblical truths.

## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Review of Scripture Memory Verses:**

* **Romans 1:20:**  For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
* **Psalm 19:1-3:** The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
* **Psalm 146:1-6:** Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul! While I live I will praise the Lord; I will sing praises to my God as long as I have breath.  Put not your trust in princes, nor in human beings, who cannot save.  Their breath departs, they return to the earth; on that very day their plans perish. Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God, the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them – he who remains faithful forever. 
* **New Verse Introduction:** James 1:12-14: Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.  Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” because God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.

**II. Live It Out: Articulate, Support, Apply**

* **Articulate:** People should live responsibly, taking into account God-given provisions, opportunities, and prohibitions.
    * **Support:** Genesis 2:7-17 (especially verse 15: "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.")
    * **Apply:**  A strong work ethic is essential, not driven by personal gain, but by God's desire. 
        * **Supporting Verse:** Colossians 3:23:  “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.”

* **Articulate:** Work is an important aspect of God's creation, instituted for man's well-being.
    * **Apply:**  Work of ministry is essential, including spreading the Gospel and demonstrating the fruits of the Spirit.  This work is empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit. 
        * **Supporting Verse:** Ephesians 2:10:  "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

* **Articulate:** God's eternality and unchangeableness. 
    * **Support:** Genesis 1:1, Psalm 90:2, Deuteronomy 33:27.
    * **Apply:**  We can trust in God's unchanging nature, find comfort in His everlasting arms, and have a greater understanding of science and the created world.

* **Articulate:** Man is created in God's image, consisting of body, soul, and spirit (tricotomy).
    * **Support:** Genesis 1:26, John 1:1, John 1:32-34.
    * **Apply:**  We are called to reflect Christ's likeness through each part of our being, taking care of our spirit, soul, and body as the temple of God.

**III. Contrast:**

* **Opposing View:** Theistic evolution, which seeks to reconcile evolutionary theory with God's creation. 
    * **Danger:** It prioritizes cultural beliefs over biblical truth, leading to a flawed interpretation of Scripture.

**IV. Share:**

* **Conversations:** How to address those who hold differing views about creation, such as theistic evolutionists or pantheists.
    * **Strategy:** Ask questions to help them see the flaws in their logic, then gently share your own faith and the biblical truth.

* Read Genesis 3:1-3 and pages 54-57 in the textbook.
