**Concise Summary:** This lesson focused on distortions of the biblical view of inspiration, contrasting the biblical understanding of plenary verbal inspiration (2 Timothy 3:16) with five common erroneous views: mechanical dictation, conceptual inspiration, partial inspiration, the Bible as containing both God's word and other content, and the Bible becoming God's word only when it impacts the reader.  The lesson emphasized the importance of understanding these distortions to effectively defend the authority and inerrancy of Scripture.  Students were assigned a writing assignment to restate an unbiblical view of inspiration and then provide a scriptural refutation.

* **Distortions of the Biblical View of Inspiration (1.1b):**
    * **Mechanical Dictation:** The erroneous view that biblical authors passively recorded God's words without personal input or interpretation. This view is refuted by emphasizing the role of human authors and their unique styles (Hebrews 1:1).
    * **Conceptual Inspiration:** The claim that only the concepts, not the specific words, of Scripture are inspired.  This is refuted by highlighting the importance of every word of Scripture (Psalm 119:130; 2 Timothy 3:16).
    * **Partial Inspiration:** The assertion that only parts of the Bible are inspired. This is refuted by emphasizing that all Scripture is inspired (2 Timothy 3:16) and that questioning the inspiration of certain passages undermines trust in the entire Bible.
    * **Bible Containing God's Word and Other Content:** The idea that the Bible is a mix of God's word and human additions. This is refuted by emphasizing that all Scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16).
    * **Bible Becoming God's Word Only Through Impact on the Reader:** The claim that a passage is only considered God's word if it personally affects the reader. This is refuted by emphasizing that God's word is authoritative regardless of personal interpretation (Deuteronomy 4:2).

* **Conclusion and Writing Assignment:**
    * Students were assigned a writing assignment to restate an unbiblical view of inspiration and then provide a scriptural refutation.  The goal was to solidify their understanding of biblical inspiration and the ability to defend this doctrine.
