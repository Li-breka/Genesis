**Concise Summary:** This lesson focused on the "Live It Out" application of Genesis chapter 5, exploring how the biblical truths learned relate to modern life and interactions.  Students shared their interpretations of key themes from the chapter, focusing on companionship, the consequences of sin, and man's tendency to rebel against God.  They then discussed practical applications of these principles and considered how to respond to situations where others are living in defiance of God or using ungodly language. The lesson concluded with homework to read pages 150-156.

* **Live It Out (Chapter 5, page 148):**
    * **Articulate:** Students identified key biblical truths from Chapter 5:
        * Man's tendency towards companionship (both positive and negative examples).
        * Disobedience always results in consequences.
        * Man's inherent tendency to rebel against God.
        * Man cannot rely on himself for fulfillment.

    * **Support:**  Students provided supporting scripture references for each truth.

    * **Apply:**  Discussion of practical applications:
        * **Companionship:** The importance of choosing godly companions who encourage faith (Psalm 11, Galatians 5:16, Genesis 2:18).  The dangers of ungodly companionship were also highlighted (Psalm 1:1).  The importance of the local church in providing a safe and supportive community was emphasized.
        * **Consequences of Sin:**  The seriousness of sin and the inevitability of consequences (Genesis 3, Genesis 6, Genesis 8, Genesis 11).  The ultimate consequence of sin (Jesus' sacrifice on the cross) was highlighted, along with the need for believers to avoid sin (Romans 6).
        * **Man's Rebellion Against God:**  The root of rebellion lies in the heart (Jeremiah 17:9).  The need to be aware of one's sinful nature and to deny oneself and follow Christ was stressed.  Examples of man's rebellion were drawn from Genesis 11.
        * **Man's Inability to Rely on Himself:**  The pursuit of worldly fulfillment apart from God leads to vanity and emptiness (Ecclesiastes 2). The importance of focusing on God's purpose and finding fulfillment in serving Him was highlighted (Colossians 3).

    * **Contrast:**  Discussion of contrasting worldviews:
        * The idea that humans are inherently good and shaped by their environment (Sigmund Freud, Jean-Jacques Rousseau).
        * The belief that following one's heart will lead to fulfillment.
        * These views were contrasted with the biblical perspective that humans are inherently sinful and need to rely on God's grace.

    * **Share:** Discussion of how to respond to specific scenarios:
        * Responding to ungodly language in the workplace (emphasizing respectful communication and opportunities to share the gospel).
        * Responding to a close friend who has turned away from God (emphasizing love, care, and opportunities for conversation).
