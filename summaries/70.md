**Concise Summary:** This Dig Deeper lesson (5.1) explored the seemingly paradoxical concepts of God's sovereignty and human free will.  The lesson emphasized the importance of considering the whole counsel of Scripture to understand both concepts, arguing that they are not mutually exclusive.  Examples from Proverbs, John 8, and 1 Samuel were used to illustrate how God's foreknowledge and control do not negate human choice.  The lesson concluded with questions prompting self-reflection on aligning personal choices with God's guidance.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Introduction:**
    * The seeming contradiction between God's sovereignty and human choice.
    * Importance of considering the whole counsel of Scripture (avoiding taking verses out of context).

* **God's Sovereignty:**
    * God's attributes of omniscience, omnipotence, and existence outside of time (not bound by time).
    * God's foreknowledge.
    * Illustration from Proverbs 21:1:  The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, illustrating God's influence on human leaders without violating their free will.  The Hebrew word for "rivers" is noted as referring to irrigation channels; God uses circumstances, not coercion.

* **Man's Free Will (Choice):**
    * The biblical evidence for human choice (e.g., Adam's choice in the Garden).
    * God's love and sacrifice for humanity despite foreknowing their rebellion (Romans 5:8).
    * John 8:58 ("Before Abraham was, I am") as evidence of God's existence outside of time.

* **The Pharaoh Example (Exodus):**
    * Pharaoh's hardening of his heart—a collaborative process between Pharaoh's choice and God's allowance of circumstances—illustrates the coexistence of God's sovereignty and human responsibility.

* **The Saul Example (1 Samuel 13:13-14):**
    * Saul's disobedience illustrates human choice within God's sovereign plan.  God's foreknowledge of Saul's actions did not prevent Saul from making his own choices.

* **Conclusion and Reflection:**
    * Questions for reflection:
        * Are you seeking God's guidance, or making choices in spite of it?
        * In what areas do you need to evaluate your choices and align them with God's will?
        * What scriptures can you claim to help you be sensitive to God's leading?
