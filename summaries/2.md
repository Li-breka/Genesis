**Concise Summary:** Lesson two of this Genesis course built upon the previous lesson's introduction by focusing on the authority and inerrancy of Scripture.  The class reviewed the concept of plenary verbal inspiration (2 Timothy 3:16), discussed the authorship of Genesis (Moses as the human author, God as the ultimate author), and defined key terms like *Pentateuch* and *inerrancy*. The importance of inerrancy for trusting the Genesis creation account and other historical and scientific claims in Scripture was emphasized.  Students were assigned homework to read pages 8-12 and memorize Ephesians 4:14-15.
