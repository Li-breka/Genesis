## Class Notes: The Creation of Man in God's Image

**Concise Summary:** This lecture explores the implications of man being created in God's image, focusing on the concept of a trichotomous human nature (body, soul, spirit). The discussion emphasizes the eternal value of humans, our moral compass, and the impact of rejecting this truth on individual worldviews and culture.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Genesis 1:27:** Establishes the foundational truth that God created man in His own image, encompassing both male and female.
* **Importance of being created in God's Image:**
    * **Eternal Soul:**  Humans possess an immaterial soul that lives eternally, reflecting God's eternal nature and leading to either an afterlife in Heaven or Hell.
    * **Inherent Value:** Because we are made in God's image, human life holds intrinsic value. This truth has implications for how we treat one another and prohibits causing harm.
    * **Trichotomous Nature:** Humans are composed of body (physical), soul (relates to the body and lives eternally), and spirit (relates to God and our ability to commune with Him).
        * Hebrews 4:12 supports the distinction between soul and spirit, indicating the Word of God is powerful enough to divide them.
    * **Reflections of God's Image:**
        * **Creativity:** Just as God is the ultimate Creator, humans exhibit creativity in various forms (art, music, athletics, etc.).
        * **Sovereignty:**  Humans possess a degree of sovereignty and dominion over creation, reflecting God's ultimate authority.
        * **Community:**  The desire for relationships and community stems from God's relational nature, reflected in our own longing for connection.
        * **Morality:**  Our inherent sense of right and wrong stems from God's moral nature. This moral compass differentiates us from animals and informs our conscience. (See James 4:17) 

* **Denying Man's Creation in God's Image:**
    * Leads to moral relativism, where truth and morality become subjective and lead to a slippery slope of ethical dilemmas.
    * Impacts culture by fostering a disregard for the inherent value of human life and creating a fragmented society.

**Homework:**
* Review pages 16-34 and prepare for further discussion.
* Memorize Psalm 146:1-6 for an upcoming quiz in lesson 14.
