**Concise Summary:** This lesson introduced chapter 6, focusing on apologeticsâ€”defending one's faith.  The core concept is that effective apologetics requires knowing one's beliefs, understanding why those beliefs are held, and communicating them with gracious humility. The lesson explored common responses to sharing faith (e.g., disbelief, claims of multiple paths to salvation, relativism), emphasizing the importance of a proper attitude (meekness, controlled strength, and healthy fear of God's judgment) and reliance on the Holy Spirit.  The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) was highlighted as a call to share the gospel.
