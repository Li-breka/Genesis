**Concise Summary:**

This lesson focuses on applying biblical truths learned from the creation narrative (Genesis 1-2) to daily life.  The class reviews several key scripture passages (Romans 1:20, Psalm 19:1-3, Psalm 146:1-6, James 1:12-14) and then works through the "Live It Out" section of the textbook, which involves articulating, supporting, and applying biblical truths. Students discuss the implications of God's plan for work and rest, His eternality, and the trichotomy of man (body, soul, spirit). The lesson concludes with a discussion on contrasting worldviews (e.g., theistic evolution) and how to engage in meaningful conversations about faith with others.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Scripture Review:**
    * Romans 1:20: God's eternal power and deity are evident in creation.
    * Psalm 19:1-3: The heavens declare God's glory.
    * Psalm 146:1-6: Praise God, not human authorities.
    * James 1:12-14: Blessed is the one who endures temptation; God is not the source of temptation.

* **Live It Out - Articulate, Support, Apply:**
    * **Responsibility and Work Ethic:**
        * **Articulate:** People should live responsibly.
        * **Support:** Genesis 2:8-17 (God placed Adam in the garden to dress and keep it).
        * **Apply:** Work is hard, but rest is important (Genesis 2; Colossians 3:23).  Work should be done for God's glory.
    * **God's Workmanship and Ministry:**
        * **Articulate:** Work is an important aspect of God's creation.
        * **Support:** Ephesians 2:10 (created in God's image).
        * **Apply:**  Work encompasses ministry (spreading the gospel, showing the fruits of the Spirit). God equips us for this work through the Holy Spirit.
    * **God's Eternality:**
        * **Articulate:** God has no beginning and no end.
        * **Support:** Genesis 1:1, Psalm 90:2, Deuteronomy 33:27.
        * **Apply:** We can rely on God's unchanging nature in a chaotic world.  His eternality informs our understanding of creation and science.
    * **Man as Trichotomy (Body, Soul, Spirit):**
        * **Articulate:** Man is made in God's image and has three parts (body, soul, spirit).
        * **Support:** Genesis 1:26, John 1:1, John 1:32-34.
        * **Apply:**  We should care for our body, soul, and spirit.  Our spirit communes with God, our soul is eternal, and our body is God's temple.

* **Contrast:**
    * **Theistic Evolution:**  The danger of interpreting the Bible through the lens of a secular worldview (science over Scripture).

* **Share:**
    * How to engage in conversations about faith with others who hold differing worldviews (theistic evolution, pantheism).  Focus on asking questions and sharing the hope of the Gospel.

* **Homework:** Genesis 3:1-3 and textbook pages 54-57; continue memorizing James 1:12-14.

**Definitions/Formulas (Optional):**

* **Theistic Evolution:** A belief system that attempts to reconcile the scientific theory of evolution with the existence and involvement of God.
* **Pantheism:** The belief that God is everything and everywhere, and that everything is part of God.
* **Trichotomy:** The theological concept that humans are composed of three distinct parts: body, soul, and spirit.
