## Bulleted Outline

**I. Consequences of the Fall**

* **Eve's Consequences** 
    * **Sorrow in childbirth:**  God states that Eve will experience pain and sorrow when giving birth due to the fall. This sorrow is connected to the pain of childbirth and the realization that children are born into a fallen world. 
    * **Challenges to God-given roles:** The fall impacts the roles of husband and wife, creating challenges to loving leadership for men and loving submission for women. 
    * **Hope for restoration:** While the fall presents challenges, there is hope for restoration through understanding God's plan for marriage and following the leading of the Holy Spirit. 
* **Adam's Consequences**
    * **Cursed Ground:** God curses the ground, making it more difficult for Adam to work and provide for his family. This highlights the connection between the fall and the struggle to work and provide.
    * **Sweat of his brow:**  Adam will now work by the sweat of his brow, indicating that work, while not inherently cursed, will become more challenging and laborious.

**II.  The Question of Bad Things Happening to Good People**

* **Challenging the Christian Worldview:** Critics often question why bad things happen to good people, challenging the belief that God is good and just.
* **The Fall as a Framework:**  This question arises from a worldview that sees humans as essentially good, while the fall emphasizes that humanity is inherently sinful.
* **The Wages of Sin:**  The consequence of sin is death, which the Bible describes as eternal separation from God. 
* **God's Grace as a Solution:**  God's grace, through Jesus Christ, offers forgiveness and restoration, allowing believers to overcome sin and its consequences. 

**III. Consequences of Sin Today**

* **Broken Fellowship with God:** Sin always results in a broken fellowship with God, though it doesn't necessarily negate salvation.
* **Importance of Confession:**  The consequences of sin should drive us to confess our sins and restore fellowship with God. 
* **Application to Daily Life:**  Sin continues to have consequences in our daily lives, impacting our relationships and our walk with God.
