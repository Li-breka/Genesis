## Class Notes - Bible and Creation Review

**Song:**

* The Bible Stands (pg. 48, verses 1 & 4)
    * Key Lyric: "By grace alone I expect to live it and to prove it and make it mine" - We need God's grace to live the Christian life, not just read about it.

**Scripture Memory:**

* **Psalm 146:1-6 (Girls vs. Guys Challenge)**
    * Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live I will praise the Lord; I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
    * Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
    * His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
    * Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
    * Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever.

**Song:**

* To God Be the Glory (pg. 80)

**Chapter 2 Review: Creation**

**2.1 - The Creator:**

* **Key Characteristics of God in Genesis 1:1:**
    * **Eternal:** Not bound by time, therefore able to create time.
    * **Creator:**  God created the world, it did not appear by accident or chance.
* **Creation vs. Evolution:**
    * Both are founded on **faith**.
        * Creation: Faith in the Bible's account.
        * Evolution: Faith in the Big Bang or gradual development from lower life forms.
    *  Evolution requires more faith due to gaps in the theory.
    * The Bible does not conflict with true science. 
* **Ex Nihilo:** God created the world out of nothing.

**2.2 - The Days of Creation:**

* **Correlation of Days:**
    * Day 1: Light and Dark -  Day 4: Sun, Moon, and Stars
    * Day 2: Firmament (Sky/Atmosphere) - Day 5: Aquatic Life and Birds
    * Day 3: Dry Land and Plants - Day 6: Land Animals and Man
* **24-Hour Day View:**
    * Evidence in Scripture points to literal 24-hour days (evening and morning cycle, repetition of the word "day").
    * Day-Age Theory/Gap Theory: Attempts to insert evolutionary timelines into creation, leading to theistic evolution.
    * **Discussion Point:**  Does believing in long ages of creation change who God is?
        * Could imply God lacked the power to create quickly.
        * Diminishes the magnificence and purposefulness of a literal six-day creation.

**2.3 - The Creation of Man:**

* **God's Plan for Man:**
    * To glorify and worship Him.
    * To enjoy Him and His creation.
    * To have dominion over the earth (responsibility and stewardship).
* **Man Created in God's Image:**
    * **Creativity:** Reflecting God's ability to create.
    * **Community/Relationships:**  Reflecting God's relational nature and desire for fellowship with us.
    * **Morality:**  Innate sense of right and wrong, reflecting God's perfect moral character.
    * **Sovereignty/Authority:**  Given dominion over the earth, reflecting God's ultimate authority.
* **Value and Sanctity of Life:**  Because we are made in God's image, we have inherent value regardless of any other factor.

**Homework:**

* Read Genesis 1:28-31 (for discussion next lesson).
* Read pages 35-38 in the textbook and take notes.
* **Prepare for oral verse quiz on Psalm 146:1-6 (next lesson).**
