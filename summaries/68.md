**Concise Summary:** This lesson continued the study of Genesis chapter 10, focusing on the descendants of Noah's sons and their establishment of nations.  The significance of the genealogy in establishing the nations that Israel would later encounter was emphasized, along with the contrasting legacies of Canaan (ungodly) and Shem (godly, leading to the lineage of Abraham and the Messiah).  The lesson highlighted the ongoing theme of individual choice in shaping one's spiritual heritage, along with God's sovereignty.  Students reviewed key details and discussed the meaning of "Hebrew" and its implications for believers' understanding of their place in history.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Introduction and Singing:**

    * Canaan's descendants (Canaanites) are identified, including Sidon (Phoenicians) and Heth (Hittites).
    * The Canaanites' occupation of the Promised Land and their idolatry are noted.  This leads to a discussion on the presence of idolatry in modern society and the importance of prioritizing God's glory.
    * The incomplete removal of Canaanites from the Promised Land is used as an analogy for the continued presence of ungodliness in society.


* **Shem and the Jewish Nation (page 133):**
    * The importance of Shem's descendants (Eber, Peleg, Joktan) in salvific history is emphasized, leading to the lineage of Abraham and the coming Messiah.
    * The meaning of "Hebrew" (to pass over or through) is discussed, symbolizing the nomadic nature of God's people throughout history and the temporary nature of earthly life for believers.
    * Discussion on the interplay between God's sovereignty and humanity's free will; dig deeper 5.1 is recommended for further study.
