## Class Notes: External Evidences for the Existence of God

**Concise Summary:** This lecture explored various external evidences, beyond the Bible itself, that point to the existence of God.  These evidences range from the universal human recognition of a supreme being to the purposeful design observed in nature.  The lecture emphasized that these evidences are not meant to replace faith but rather to demonstrate the logical and observable support for God's existence.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Universal Evidences:**
    -  Throughout history, diverse civilizations have recognized the existence of a supreme being.
    - This points to a natural inclination within humanity to acknowledge a power greater than ourselves.
    - Supported by Romans 1:20 which states that God's invisible qualities are clearly seen in creation.

* **Cosmological Evidence:**
    - The order and complexity of the universe point to a cause.
    -  This argument suggests that the universe could not have come into existence without a creator.
    -  John 1:3 supports this by stating "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."

* **Teleological Evidence:**
    - The purposeful design observed in nature, from intricate ecosystems to the human body, suggests an intelligent designer.
    -  This implies that the universe was not randomly formed but created with intention and purpose.
    -  Colossians 1:17 states "And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."

* **Ontological Evidence:**
    - Humans possess the idea of an infinite and perfect being, a concept that could not have originated from finite and imperfect beings.
    - This suggests that the very idea of God must have originated from God himself.
    -  Genesis 2:7 describes God breathing life into man, implying a connection between humanity and the divine.

* **Anthropological Evidence:**
    - The existence of intellectual and moral capacities within humanity points to an intellectual and moral creator.
    - This argument suggests that our ability to reason and discern right from wrong reflects attributes of God himself. 
    - Genesis 1:27 states that God created man in His image.

* **Congruity Evidence:**
    - The consistency between what the Bible teaches about God and the observable world serves as evidence for His existence.
    -  The laws of nature, the complexity of life, and the human experience align with the biblical account of creation. 

**Discussion Points:**

* Why do so many deny the existence of God despite these logical arguments?
* What additional evidence for God's existence do you see in the world around you?
* How would you initiate a conversation about God with someone who doesn't believe?
* What Scripture verses would you use to support your belief in God's existence?
