**Concise Summary:** This lesson explored the preservation of Scripture, building on previous discussions of inspiration and inerrancy.  The class reviewed the concept of plenary verbal inspiration and the authorship of Genesis (Moses as human author, God as ultimate author).  Different textual traditions were discussed, including the Received Text (New Testament) and the Masoretic Text (Old Testament), highlighting the role of both divine preservation and human involvement in the transmission of Scripture. The importance of trusting in the Holy Spirit's work in confirming the preservation of God's Word was emphasized.
