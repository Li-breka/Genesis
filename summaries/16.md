**Bulleted Outline:**

* **The Commission of Man** 
    * God gave man the commission to:
        * **Replenish the earth:** This refers to procreation and the role of marriage in expanding humanity.
        * **Have dominion:**  This signifies the responsibility to work and care for the earth. 
    * Work is presented as a positive aspect of creation, instituted and exemplified by God himself.
    * The value of mankind as image-bearers should inform our approach to caring for the earth.

* **The Sabbath Principle**
    * The Hebrew word "Sabbath" (Shabbat) means "to cease" and implies a "rest of achievement."
    * God blessed and sanctified the seventh day as a day of rest after six days of creation.
    * In the New Testament, Christians observe a Sabbath principle, which emphasizes:
        * **Physical Rest:** A cessation of work and time for rejuvenation.
        * **Spiritual Rest:** Seeking refreshment and renewal through connection with God. 
    * Sunday worship is connected to the resurrection of Christ and the feast of first fruits.
    * Resting in the Lord involves bringing burdens to Him and finding spiritual refreshment. 

* **Balancing Work and Rest**
    * The biblical model emphasizes six days of work followed by one day of rest.
    * Burnout can hinder productivity and negatively impact our ability to serve God and others.
    *  Diligence in work should be balanced with intentional rest and care for relationships. 
    *  The Christian worldview values both work and rest, recognizing their importance in fulfilling our God-given purpose. 
     
* **Honoring God Through Rest**
    * Taking a day of rest demonstrates faith in God's provision and honors the pattern He established.
    *  It allows for spiritual reflection, connection with God, and renewal for service.
