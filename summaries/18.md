## Class Notes: Opportunities and Prohibitions in Genesis

### Concise Summary:
This lecture continues the discussion on the creation of responsibility, focusing on the prohibitions given to man by God. Using the example of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the speaker explains that God's prohibitions demonstrate His love and desire to protect us from harm. The lecture connects this concept to our lives today, emphasizing the importance of trusting and obeying God even when His reasons are unclear.  The speaker utilizes the examples of curfews and church attendance to illustrate how seemingly restrictive rules from God or authority figures can ultimately lead to blessings and opportunities.

### Bulleted Outline:

* **The Prohibition (Genesis 2:17):** 
    * God prohibited Adam and Eve from eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
    * This prohibition wasn't based on the fruit's inherent danger, but rather on God's command.
* **Free Will and Trust:**
    * The prohibition introduced the concept of free will, giving man the choice to obey or disobey God.
    * This choice requires faith â€“ trusting God's word even when we don't understand His reasoning.
    * Like a parent protecting a child, God's prohibitions are meant to shield us from harm, even if we don't immediately grasp the danger. 
* **Humanism vs. Trusting God:**
    * Our culture often encourages us to "follow our hearts" and be "true to ourselves."
    * However, Proverbs warns us that the human heart is deceitful and prone to wickedness.
    * True fulfillment comes from trusting and obeying God, even when it contradicts our desires or cultural norms.
* **God's Prohibitions as Blessings:**
    * God's "no's" are often opportunities for us to demonstrate our faith and experience His blessings.
    * Examples like curfews and mandatory church attendance, though seemingly restrictive, can lead to benefits like better rest, spiritual growth, and godly relationships. 
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Trust that God's prohibitions are for our good, even when we don't understand His reasons.
    * Seek strength from God to overcome temptations and obey His commands.
    * Remember that God is faithful and will always provide a way of escape from temptation (1 Corinthians 10:13).
